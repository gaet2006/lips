# zip

A custom Oh-My-Zsh plugin for displaying your local and external IP address

Sorry about the long install, but as a new user to GitHub, I dont yet know how to use the clone function. (or how GitHub works)

__NOTICE: YOU MUST HAVE ZSH INSTALLED TO MAKE THIS WORK__

Enter these commands:
``` bash
$ ~
$ cd .oh-my-zsh
$ cd custom
$ cd plugins
$ mkdir zip
$ cd zip
$ vi zip.plugin.zsh
```

Once you have completed this copy/paste this in:

```zsh

```
